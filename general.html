        As Mary Poppins once said, 'in every job that must be done there is an element of fun!'. So we created this page to help each other out, by sharing advice about exams and papers- all from students who have already lived through them. Please contribute with anything you might want to share with your fellow students: lecture and revision notes; information about internships and year abroad; translations and typed texts; essays and anything you have written in a language etc. Please email tr418@cam.ac.uk (Tess) or jab296@cam.ac.uk (Joseph) with your contributions.
