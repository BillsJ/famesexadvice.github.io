        As Mary Poppins has said, in every job that must be done there is an element of fun! So we created this page to help out each other, to save everyone sometime, to share advice about exams and papers- all from students who have already lived through it. Please contribute with anything you might want to share with your fellow students: lecture and revision notes, information about internships and year abroad, translations and typed texts, essays and anything you have written in a language, that might be useful samples for fellow students. Please email tr418@cam.ac.uk (Tess) and jab296@cam.ac.uk (Joseph)
